## Overview

This research project investigates key data analysis tools offered by **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. By conducting **semi-structured expert interviews** with peers from the Information Technology domain, the study identifies and analyzes commonly used tools for processing large-scale datasets in the cloud.

### Core Objective

To answer the research question:  
**"What are the different data analysis tools used in Google Cloud Platform?"**

---

## Tools Explored

### 1. **BigQuery**
- Fully managed, serverless data warehouse.
- Handles petabyte-scale datasets.
- Supports SQL-based querying and secure access.
- Most frequently mentioned tool in interviews (80%).

### 2. **Cloud Dataflow**
- Stream and batch data processing tool.
- Built on Apache Beam.
- Commonly used for ETL and pipeline orchestration.

### 3. **Cloud Dataprep**
- Visual tool for cleaning and preparing data.
- Useful for handling both structured and unstructured datasets.
- Provides transformation without coding.

## Methodology

- **Research Design:** Semi-structured interviews
- **Sample Size:** 5 student participants (randomly selected)
- **Data Collection:** In-person and Microsoft Teams interviews
- **Analysis Method:** Thematic Analysis (Braun & Clarke)

---

## Key Findings

- **BigQuery** was identified as the most preferred tool due to scalability, performance, and built-in security.
- **Dataflow** was praised for real-time stream processing and ETL capabilities.
- **Dataprep** helped with preprocessing but had limitations in security and complexity handling.

**Theme Frequency:**
- BigQuery: 4 mentions (80%)
- Dataflow: 3 mentions (60%)
- Dataprep: 2 mentions (40%)

---

## Limitations

- Small sample size may not fully represent broader usage trends.
- Expert pool was limited to peers from the same academic program.

## Appendix

**Interview Questions Included:**
- Knowledge of GCP
- Experience with analysis tools
- Comparison between tools like BigQuery, Dataflow, and Dataprep
- Usage scenarios and technical details

---

## Conclusion

Google Cloud Platform offers a robust set of tools for scalable, secure, and efficient data analysis. While BigQuery stands out, complementary tools like Dataflow and Dataprep enhance preprocessing and transformation capabilities, making GCP a compelling ecosystem for data professionals.
